# Security and Code Quality Fixes

This document summarizes the security and code quality issues that were systematically identified and resolved in the Scryfall MCP server codebase.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Memory Leak Prevention (RateLimiter)
**Issue**: Potential memory leak from uncleared setTimeout in RateLimiter reset method.
**Fix**: Added tracking of active timeouts and proper cleanup in the reset method.
**Files Modified**: `src/services/rate-limiter.ts`

### 2. Error Handling Consistency (ScryfallClient)
**Issue**: Inconsistent JSON parsing error handling that could lose debugging context.
**Fix**: Improved error handling to preserve original error context while providing response debugging information.
**Files Modified**: `src/services/scryfall-client.ts`

### 3. Input Sanitization
**Issue**: Missing input sanitization for user-controlled query strings.
**Fix**: Created comprehensive input sanitization utility with query validation and character filtering.
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/utils/query-sanitizer.ts` (new)
- `src/tools/search-cards.ts`
- `src/tools/get-card.ts`
- `src/tools/build-scryfall-query.ts`

### 4. Validation System Consistency
**Issue**: Inconsistent error handling between sync and async validation functions.
**Fix**: Consolidated validation logic into unified approach with consistent error reporting.
**Files Modified**: `src/utils/validators.ts`

### 5. Resource Exhaustion Prevention (Cache)
**Issue**: Unbounded cache growth could lead to memory exhaustion.
**Fix**: Implemented LRU eviction policy with configurable size and memory limits.
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/services/cache-service.ts`
- `.env.example`

### 6. Configuration Security
**Issue**: Hardcoded sensitive information in User-Agent header.
**Fix**: Made User-Agent fully configurable through environment variables only.
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/types/mcp-types.ts`
- `src/services/scryfall-client.ts`
- `.env.example`

### 7. Race Condition Prevention (RateLimiter)
**Issue**: Potential race condition in queue processing logic.
**Fix**: Added proper atomic operations and exception handling.
**Files Modified**: `src/services/rate-limiter.ts`

### 8. Environment Variable Validation
**Issue**: Missing validation for numeric conversion of environment variables.
**Fix**: Created safe environment variable parsing utility with validation and fallbacks.
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/utils/env-parser.ts` (new)
- Multiple service files updated to use safe parsing

### 9. Enhanced Error Context
**Issue**: Insufficient error context in generic error handlers.
**Fix**: Added comprehensive error context with debugging information and correlation IDs.
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/tools/search-cards.ts`
- `src/tools/get-card.ts`

### 10. Prototype Pollution Prevention
**Issue**: Potential prototype pollution in error class constructors.
**Fix**: Added sanitization of details objects to prevent prototype pollution attacks.
**Files Modified**: `src/types/mcp-errors.ts`

## Security Improvements

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are now sanitized and validated
2. **Resource Limits**: Implemented bounds on cache size and memory usage
3. **Error Safety**: Enhanced error handling with secure context preservation
4. **Configuration Security**: Removed hardcoded sensitive values
5. **Memory Safety**: Fixed potential memory leaks and unbounded growth

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Consistent Error Handling**: Unified error handling patterns across the codebase
2. **Environment Safety**: Safe parsing of environment variables with validation
3. **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript usage with proper type validation
4. **Testing**: All fixes validated with comprehensive test suite
5. **Logging**: Improved error context and debugging information

## Configuration Changes

New environment variables added for better security and configurability:
- `CACHE_MAX_SIZE`: Maximum number of cache entries
- `CACHE_MAX_MEMORY_MB`: Maximum cache memory usage in MB
- Enhanced validation for all existing environment variables

## Verification

All fixes have been:
- ✅ Type-checked with TypeScript
- ✅ Linted with ESLint (warnings only, no errors)
- ✅ Tested with comprehensive test suite (146 tests passing)
- ✅ Verified for backwards compatibility

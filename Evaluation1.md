I used the Scryfall MCP package to build a Historic Brawl deck centered around Obeka, Splitter of Seconds. Here is my evaluation of the tools provided:

## Tools That Performed Exceptionally Well

### 1. **`scryfall:search_cards`** - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This was the MVP tool for the deck building process. It excelled at:
- **Complex query handling**: Successfully parsed queries like `oracle:"beginning of your upkeep" (oracle:"draw" OR oracle:"create" OR oracle:"return") legal:brawl (color:u OR color:b OR color:r)`
- **Arena filtering**: The `arena_only=true` parameter was crucial for ensuring deck legality
- **Format restrictions**: `legal:brawl` filtering worked perfectly
- **Rich results**: Provided comprehensive card information including mana costs, oracle text, and pricing

### 2. **`scryfall:validate_brawl_commander`** - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Performed flawlessly by:
- Confirming Obeka's commander legality
- Providing clear format constraints (100 cards, singleton, color identity)
- Verifying Arena availability
- Giving helpful deck building reminders

### 3. **`scryfall:get_card`** - ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Worked perfectly for getting detailed commander information:
- Complete oracle text and abilities
- Accurate mana cost and stats
- Format legality across all formats
- Current pricing information

## Tools That Underperformed

### 1. **`scryfall:find_synergistic_cards`** - ⭐⭐
This tool was disappointing:
- **Failed to find results**: Returned "No synergistic cards found" for Obeka despite clear synergies existing
- **Too narrow focus**: Seemed to look for very specific mechanical synergies rather than broader strategic synergies
- **Missed obvious connections**: Didn't identify upkeep-trigger cards as synergistic with extra upkeep steps

### 2. **`scryfall:search_format_staples`** - ⭐⭐⭐
Not used extensively, but when tested it felt:
- **Too generic**: Would likely return standard good cards rather than build-around synergies
- **Less useful for niche strategies**: Better for netdecking than creative deck building

## Tools Not Needed/Used

Several tools weren't necessary for this task:
- **Price/alternative tools**: Deck building didn't require budget optimization
- **Batch analysis**: Working with individual cards was sufficient
- **Rules queries**: No complex rules interactions needed clarification
- **Random card generator**: Focused search was more valuable

## Overall Assessment: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Strengths:
1. **Comprehensive search capabilities** made finding specific synergies easy
2. **Arena filtering** ensured practical deck building
3. **Rich card data** provided everything needed for evaluation
4. **Format validation** gave confidence in deck legality

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Synergy detection** needs work - the tool should recognize that "extra upkeep steps" synergizes with "beginning of your upkeep" triggers
2. **Thematic grouping** could help organize results better for deck building
3. **Deck composition analysis** tools could suggest mana curves, land counts, etc.

### Key Success Factor:
The **manual query construction** approach worked much better than relying on automated synergy detection. Being able to craft specific searches like `oracle:"beginning of your upkeep"` was more valuable than the AI trying to guess what cards would work well together.

## Recommendation:
The Scryfall MCP is excellent for **manual, targeted deck building** where you know what you're looking for, but needs improvement in **automated synergy discovery** for truly creative deck building assistance.

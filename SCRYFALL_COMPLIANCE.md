# Scryfall API Compliance Guide

This document describes the compliance-related behavior that exists in the current implementation. It is intentionally narrower than a legal policy document.

## What The Server Does Today

### Request Headers

- Sends `Accept: application/json` on JSON API requests.
- Sends a configurable `User-Agent` header on Scryfall requests.
- Uses HTTPS for Scryfall API traffic.

The default `User-Agent` is controlled by `.env.example` and can be overridden with `SCRYFALL_USER_AGENT`. Scryfall asks API clients to send an accurate user agent for the actual usage context, preferably including an application or script name, version, and contact or repository information.

### Rate Limiting

- Defaults to a 100 ms minimum interval between Scryfall requests.
- Enforces a 500 ms minimum interval for Scryfall's documented 2/sec endpoints: `/cards/search`, `/cards/named`, `/cards/random`, and `/cards/collection`.
- Records `429` responses, honors `Retry-After` when present, and delays later requests through the shared limiter.
- Tracks repeated failures and uses a circuit-breaker path to avoid hammering an unhealthy upstream.
- Treats direct bulk file downloads from Scryfall file origins separately from ordinary API traffic.

### Caching

Current cache durations in code:

- card search: 30 minutes
- card details: 24 hours
- card prices: 6 hours
- set data: 1 week
- bulk data: 24 hours

Important implementation notes:

- bulk card data is discovered through the bulk endpoint, streamed from the direct download URI, and cached as a serialized snapshot
- set filtering is derived from one canonical cached `/sets` dataset
- cache size and memory usage are bounded in-process
- oversized bulk snapshots are streamed through disk and retained on disk for warm reads when the serialized payload is too large for the configured in-memory cache

### Bulk Data

- Uses Scryfall bulk data for the card database resource.
- Treats bulk downloads separately from ordinary card-search traffic.
- Does not treat bulk prices as a storefront-grade source of truth; Scryfall documents bulk prices as stale after 24 hours.

### Images And Attribution

- Card detail responses include Scryfall source links and artist attribution when Scryfall provides them.
- The server returns Scryfall image URLs rather than transforming, watermarking, recoloring, or embedding modified image payloads.
- Consumers that render card images should preserve copyright, artist, and source context and avoid cropping, clipping, stretching, skewing, recoloring, watermarking, or implying non-Wizards ownership of card imagery.

## Developer Guidance

Do:

- keep using `ScryfallClient` instead of ad hoc fetch code
- preserve the configured `User-Agent`
- keep rate limiting and caching in place when adding new Scryfall-backed features
- prefer bulk data when the use case needs a large card corpus
- use fresh card API lookups, not bulk data, when a workflow needs current prices

Do not:

- bypass the shared rate limiter
- add duplicate network calls when existing code already fetched equivalent metadata
- treat filtered cache entries as reusable unless every result-affecting dimension is represented
- remove attribution or source links from card/image-facing output

## Useful Runtime Checks

The current public server helpers are:

```ts
const status = server.getStatus();
const health = await server.healthCheck();
```

`getStatus()` exposes cache, rate limiter, tool, resource, prompt, and monitoring state. `healthCheck()` performs the current health probe flow.

This guide is about implementation behavior in this repository. It is not legal advice, and it does not replace Scryfall's own terms or documentation.

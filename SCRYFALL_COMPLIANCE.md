  maxRetries: 3,
  backoffMultiplier: 2,
  maxBackoffMs: 5000
};
```

### Cache Durations
```typescript
export const CACHE_DURATIONS = {
  card_search: 30 * 60 * 1000,      // 30 minutes
  card_details: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours (minimum required)
  card_prices: 6 * 60 * 60 * 1000,   // 6 hours (prices updated daily)
  set_data: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 week
  bulk_data: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,    // 24 hours
};
```

### User-Agent Customization

## 🚨 Compliance Monitoring

The server includes built-in compliance monitoring:

### Rate Limit Monitoring
```typescript
// Check rate limiter status
const status = server.getRateLimiterStatus();
console.log(`Queue length: ${status.queueLength}`);
console.log(`Consecutive errors: ${status.consecutiveErrors}`);
```

### Cache Performance
```typescript
// Monitor cache hit rates
const cacheStats = server.getCacheStats();
console.log(`Cache hit rate: ${cacheStats.hitRate * 100}%`);
```

### Health Checks
```typescript
// Overall system health
const health = await server.healthCheck();
console.log(`Status: ${health.status}`);
```
